TEMPLATE FOR USING CHEAP YELLOW DISPLAY WITH SQUARELINE STUDIO AND PLATFORMIO ARDUINO FRAMEWORK

Extract the zip to a folder where you wish to keep your new project.
(You may want to keep a folder just for the template and duplicate that for each new project).
In Visual Studio Code with Platformio, open the template folder.
When you first open the folder containing this template, platformio will load the necessary libraries.

This template includes a simple project from Squareline Studio ("SLS")
  It is already in the src/ui directory.  
  You can build and upload this project to your CYD as a test if you like.
  The project has a blue button.  When it is pressed, the ball will drop and bounce off the button.

You will be exporting your SLS ui into that directory AFTER
  first deleting all the files in that directory.


To insert (export) a project from SLS, first set your export parameters in File/Project Settings

    Width:320
    Height: 240
    Depth: 16-bit
    Board Group: Arduino
    Board: Arduino with TFT_eSPI

    Set UI Files Export Path to the path to your projects's src/ui folder.
      for example:
        C:\Users\owner\Documents\PlatformIO\Projects\Squareline Studio CYD Base Project\src\ui\filelist.txt

    Set Call functions export file to .cpp

    click on APPLY CHANGES

    Note the LVGL version here and make sure you platfomio.ini lib-dep references the same version
      for example:
        lib_deps = 
	        bodmer/TFT_eSPI@^2.5.42
	        https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen.git ;#v1.4
	        lvgl/lvgl@^8.3.6 ; align this rev with the rev used by Squareline Studio

Then to actually export the SLS project into your platformio project, click Export/Export UI Files

Next you have to copy files to different locations.  These files are in the directory "NECESARY TEMPLATE FILES"
    copy lv_conf.h to .pio\libdeps\cyd\lv_conf.h
    copy User_Setup.h to .pio\libdeps\cyd\TFT_eSPI
    (these paths are noted in the comment at the top of each file)

Check that all of the fonts you used in the SLS project are turned on.  These start at line 366 of lv_conf.h
   "1" indicates that you need the font, "0" indicates that you do not need the font.

DO NOT move the lvgl examples directory into your src folder.  In fact, you can delete this and the demos directory
 if you wish.  The compilation of these directories is already turned off in lv_conf.h

In main.cpp, confirm the rotation of the display matches your project design.  line 126 of main.cpp
       tft.setRotation(1); // Landscape orientation  1 =  CYC usb on right, 2 for vertical

You should now be able to build your project and further edit the main.cpp code to add necessary real-world
  interfaces, etc.
